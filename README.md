# Churn rate prediction
Besides the code I have also provided the raw data to better understand the code.

## Project description
The gym chain Model Fitness (fictive) developed a customer interaction strategy based on analytical data.
In order to fight churn, Model Fitness has digitized a number of its customer profiles.
I analyzed them and came up with a customer retention strategy.
It's at the end of the code in the notebook.
